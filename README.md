# code-brush
This repo is created to practice and brush up my coding skills. I will start
with leetcode and (ocassionaly) problems from the books I am reading, such as 
"Programming Pearls". Uploaded leetcode solutions have passed online judgement.

C++ is my choice of languange. As for now, I exclusively use Python in my Ph.D.
studies, it feels like I almost forget how to use C++ which is my main language
for many years. Besides, I mainly code in academia, so my codes may not meet 
industry standards. That is being said, any comments andsuggestions about the 
codes and algoritms will be much appreciated and welcomed.

## Problem Category
To start, problems are organized by their source (leetcode/book). They will be 
organized by solution or problem type later after I solved enough problems.

## Complie
All codes are written and complied in Linux. Source of the current solving problem
is named as 'main.cpp'. The Makefile complies main.cpp to the bin called 'brush'.
Header file 'common.h' includes commonly used headers plus some utils I used in my
previous projects.
